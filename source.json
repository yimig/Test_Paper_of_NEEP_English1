                    "question": "Of all the changes that have taken place in English-language newspapers during the past quarter-century, perhaps the m ost far-reaching has been the inexorable decline in the scope and seriousness of their arts coverage.\nIt is difficult to the point of impossibility for the average reader under the age of forty to imagine a time when high-quality arts criticism could be found in most big-city newspapers. Yet a considerable number of the most significant collections of criticism published in the 20th century consisted in large part of new spaper reviews. To read such books today is to marvel at the fact that their learned contents were once deemed suitable for publication in general-circulation dailies.\nWe are even farther removed from the unfocused newspaper reviews published in England between the turn of t he 20th century and the eve of World War Ⅱ, at a time when newsprint was dirt-cheap and stylish arts criticism was considered an ornament to the publications in which it appeared. In those far-off days, it was taken for granted tha t the cri tics of major papers would write in detail and at length about the events they covered. Theirs was a serious business, and even those reviewers who wore their learning lightly, like George Bern ard Shaw and Ernest Newman, could be trusted to know what they were a bout. These men believed in journalism as a calling, and were proud to be published in the daily press. “So few authors have brains enough or literary gift enough to keep their own end up in journalism, ”Newman wrote, “ that I am tempted to define‘journalism’ as ‘a term of contempt applied by writers who are not read to writers who are’. ”\nUnfortunately, these critics are virtually forgotten. Neville Cardus, who wrote for the Manchester Guardian from 1917 until shortly before his death in 1975, is now known solely as a writer of essays ont he game of cricket. During his lifetime, though, he was also one of England's foremost classical-music critics, and a stylist so widely admired that his Autobiography(1947)became a best-seller. He was knighted in 1967, the first music critic to be so honored. Yet on ly one of his books is now in print, and his vast body of writings on music is unknown save to specialists.\nIs there any chance that Cardus’s criticism will enjoy a revival? The prospect seems remote. Journalistic tastes had changed long before his death, and postmodern reader shave little use for the ric hly upholstered Vicwardian prose in which he specialized. Moreover, the amateur tradition in music criticism has been in headlong retreat.\n　　21. It is indicated in Paragraphs 1 and 2 that\n　　[A] arts criticism has disappeared from big-city newspapers.\n　　[B] English-language newspapers used to carry more arts reviews.\n　　[C] high-quality newspapers retain a large body of readers.\n　　[D] young readers doubt the suitability of criticism on dailies.\n　　22. Newspaper reviews in England before world warⅡwere characterized by\n　　[A] free themes.\n　　[B] casual style.\n　　[C] elaborate layout.\n　　[D] radical viewpoints.\n　　23. which of the following would Shaw and Newman most probably agree on?\n　　[A] It is writers’ duty to fulfill journalistic goals.\n　　[B] It is contemptible for writers to be journalists.\n　　[C] Writers are likely to be tempted into journalism.\n　　[D] Not all writers are capable of journalistic writing.\n　　24. What can be learned about Cardus according to the last two paragraphs?\n　　[A] His music criticism may not appeal to readers today.\n　　[B] His reputation as a music critic has long been in dispute.\n　　[C]His style caters largely to modern specialists.\n　　[D]His writings fail to follow the amateur tradition.\n　　25. What would be the best title for the text?\n　　[A] Newspapers of the Good Old Days.\n　　[B] The lost Horizon in Newspapers.\n　　[C] Mournful Decline of Journalism.\n　　[D] Prominent Critics in Memory."

                    "question": "Over the past decade, thousands of patents have been granted for what are called business methods. Amazon.com received one for its “one-click” online payment system. Merrill Lynch got legal protection for an asset allocation strategy. One inventor patented a technique for lifting a box.\nNow the nation’s top patent court appears completely ready to scale back on business-method patents, which have been controversial ever since they were first authorized 10 years ago. In a move that has intellectual-property lawyers abuzz the U.S. court of Appeals for the federal circuit said it would use a particular case to conduct a broad review of business-method patents. In re Bilski , as the case is known , is “a very big deal”, says Dennis’D. Crouch of the University of Missouri School of law. It “has the potential to eliminate an entire class of patents.”\nCurbs on business-method claims would be a dramatic about-face, because it was the federal circuit itself that introduced such patents with is 1998 decision in the so-called state Street Bank case, approving a patent on a way of pooling mutual-fund assets. That ruling produced an explosion in business-method patent filings, initially by emerging internet companies trying to stake out exclusive pinhts to specific types of online transactions. Later, move established companies raced to add such patents to their files, if only as a defensive move against rivals that might beat them to the punch. In 2005, IBM noted in a court filing that it had been issued more than 300 business-method patents despite the fact that it questioned the legal basis for granting them. Similarly, some Wall Street investment films armed themselves with patents for financial products, even as they took positions in court cases opposing the practice.\nThe Bilski case involves a claimed patent on a method for hedging risk in the energy market. The Federal circuit issued an unusual order stating that the case would be heard by all 12 of the court’s judges, rather than a typical panel of three, and that one issue it wants to evaluate is whether it should” reconsider” its state street Bank ruling.\nThe Federal Circuit’s action comes in the wake of a series of recent decisions by the supreme Count that has narrowed the scope of protections for patent holders. Last April, for example the justices signaled that too many patents were being upheld for “inventions” that are obvious. The judges on the Federal circuit are “reacting to the anti_ patent trend at the supreme court” ,says Harole C.wegner, a partend attorney and professor at aeorge Washington University Law School.\n　　26. Business-method patents have recently aroused concern because of\n　　[A] their limited value to business\n　　[B] their connection with asset allocation\n　　[C] the possible restriction on their granting\n　　[D] the controversy over authorization\n　　27. Which of the following is true of the Bilski case?\n　　[A] Its ruling complies with the court decisions\n　　[B] It involves a very big business transaction\n　　[C] It has been dismissed by the Federal Circuit\n　　[D] It may change the legal practices in the U.S.\n　　28. The word “about-face” (Line 1, Paro 3) most probably means\n　　[A] loss of good will\n　　[B] increase of hostility\n　　[C] change of attitude\n　　[D] enhancement of dignity\n　　29. We learn from the last two paragraphs that business-method patents\n　　[A] are immune to legal challenges\n　　[B] are often unnecessarily issued\n　　[C] lower the esteem for patent holders\n　　[D] increase the incidence of risks\n　　30. Which of the following would be the subject of the text?\n　　[A] A looming threat to business-method patents\n　　[B] Protection for business-method patent holders\n　　[C] A legal case regarding business-method patents\n　　[D] A prevailing trend against business-method patents"

                    "question": "In his book The Tipping Point, Malcolm Aladuell argues that social epidemics are driven in large part by the acting of a tiny minority of special individuals, often called influentials, who are unusually informed, persuasive, or well-connected. The idea is intuitively compelling, but it doesn’t explain how ideas actually spread.\nThe supposed importance of influentials derives from a plausible sounding but largely untested theory called the “two step flow of communication”: Information flows from the media to the influentials and from them to everyone else. Marketers have embraced the two-step flow because it suggests that if they can just find and influence the influentials, those selected people will do most of the work for them. The theory also seems to explain the sudden and unexpected popularity of certain looks, brands, or neighborhoods. In many such cases, a cursory search for causes finds that some small group of people was wearing, promoting, or developing whatever it is before anyone else paid attention. Anecdotal evidence of this kind fits nicely with the idea that only certain special people can drive trends\nIn their recent work, however, some researchers have come up with the finding that influentials have far less impact on social epidemics than is generally supposed. In fact, they don’t seem to be required of all.\nThe researchers’ argument stems from a simple observing about social influence, with the exception of a few celebrities like Oprah Winfrey-whose outsize presence is primarily a function of media, not interpersonal, influence-even the most influential members of a population simply don’t interact with that many others. Yet it is precisely these non-celebrity influentials who, according to the two-step-flow theory, are supposed to drive social epidemics by influencing their friends and colleagues directly. For a social epidemic to occur, however, each person so affected, must then influence his or her own acquaintances, who must in turn influence theirs, and so on; and just how many others pay attention to each of these people has little to do with the initial influential. If people in the network just two degrees removed from the initial influential prove resistant, for example from the initial influential prove resistant, for example the cascade of change won’t propagate very far or affect many people.\nBuilding on the basic truth about interpersonal influence, the researchers studied the dynamics of populations manipulating a number of variables relating of populations, manipulating a number of variables relating to people’s ability to influence others and their tendency to be influenced. Our work shows that the principal requirement for what we call “global cascades”- the widespread propagation of influence through networks - is the presence not of a few influentials but, rather, of a critical mass of easily influenced people, each of whom adopts, say, a look or a brand after being exposed to a single adopting neighbor. Regardless of how influential an individual is locally, he or she can exert global influence only if this critical mass is available to propagate a chain reaction.\n　　31.By citing the book The Tipping Point, the author intends to\n　　[A]analyze the consequences of social epidemics\n　　[B]discuss influentials’ function in spreading ideas\n　　[C]exemplify people’s intuitive response to social epidemics\n　　[D]describe the essential characteristics of influentials.\n　　32.The author suggests that the “two-step-flow theory”\n　　[A]serves as a solution to marketing problems\n　　[B]has helped explain certain prevalent trends\n　　[C]has won support from influentials\n　　[D]requires solid evidence for its validity\n　　33.what the researchers have observed recently shows that\n　　[A] the power of influence goes with social interactions\n　　[B] interpersonal links can be enhanced through the media\n　　[C] influentials have more channels to reach the public\n　　[D] most celebrities enjoy wide media attention\n　　34.The underlined phrase “these people” in paragraph 4 refers to the ones who\n　　[A] stay outside the network of social influence\n　　[B] have little contact with the source of influence\n　　[C] are influenced and then influence others\n　　[D] are influenced by the initial influential\n　　35.what is the essential element in the dynamics of social influence?\n　　[A]The eagerness to be accepted\n　　[B]The impulse to influence others\n　　[C]The readiness to be influenced\n　　[D]The inclination to rely on others"

                    "question": "Bankers have been blaming themselves for their troubles in public. Behind the scenes, they have been taking aim at someone else: the accounting standard-setters. Their rules, moan the banks, have forced them to report enormous losses, and it’s just not fair. These rules say they must value some assets at the price a third party would pay, not the price managers and regulators would like them to fetch.\nUnfortunately, banks’ lobbying now seems to be working. The details may be unknowable, but the independence of standard-setters, essential to the proper functioning of capital markets, is being compromised. And, unless banks carry toxic assets at prices that attract buyers, reviving the banking system will be difficult.\nAfter a bruising encounter with Congress, America’s Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rushed through rule changes. These gave banks more freedom to use models to value illiquid assets and more flexibility in recognizing losses on long-term assets in their income statement. Bob Herz, the FASB’s chairman, cried out against those who “question our motives.” Yet bank shares rose and the changes enhance what one lobby group politely calls “the use of judgment by management.”\nEuropean ministers instantly demanded that the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) do likewise. The IASB says it does not want to act without overall planning, but the pressure to fold when it completes it reconstruction of rules later this year is strong. Charlie McCreevy, a European commissioner, warned the IASB that it did “not live in a political vacuum” but “in the real word” and that Europe could yet develop different rules.\nIt was banks that were on the wrong planet, with accounts that vastly overvalued assets. Today they argue that market prices overstate losses, because they largely reflect the temporary illiquidity of markets, not the likely extent of bad debts. The truth will not be known for years. But bank’s shares trade below their book value, suggesting that investors are skeptical. And dead markets partly reflect the paralysis of banks which will not sell assets for fear of booking losses, yet are reluctant to buy all those supposed bargains.\nTo get the system working again, losses must be recognized and dealt with. America’s new plan to buy up toxic assets will not work unless banks mark assets to levels which buyers find attractive. Successful markets require independent and even combative standard-setters. The FASB and IASB have been exactly that, cleaning up rules on stock options and pensions, for example, against hostility form special interests. But by giving in to critics now they are inviting pressure to make more concessions.\n　　36. Bankers complained that they were forced to\n　　[A] follow unfavorable asset evaluation rules\n　　[B]collect payments from third parties\n　　[C]cooperate with the price managers\n　　[D]reevaluate some of their assets.\n　　37.According to the author , the rule changes of the FASB may result in\n　　[A]the diminishing role of management\n　　[B]the revival of the banking system\n　　[C]the banks’ long-term asset losses\n　　[D]the weakening of its independence\n　　38.According to Paragraph 4, McCreevy objects to the IASB’s attempt to\n　　[A]keep away from political influences.\n　　[B]evade the pressure from their peers.\n　　[C]act on their own in rule-setting.\n　　[D]take gradual measures in reform.\n　　39.The author thinks the banks were “on the wrong planet ”in that they\n　　[A]misinterpreted market price indicators\n　　[B]exaggerated the real value of their assets\n　　[C]neglected the likely existence of bad debts.\n　　[D]denied booking losses in their sale of assets.\n　　40.The author’s attitude towards standard-setters is one of\n　　[A]satisfaction.\n　　[B]skepticism.\n　　[C]objectiveness\n　　[D]sympathy"

                    "question": "The decision of the New York Philharmonic to hire Alan Gilbert as its next music director has been the talk of the classical-music world ever since the sudden announcement of his appointment in 2009. For the most part, the response has been favorable, to say the least. “Hooray! At last!” wrote Anthony Tommasini, a sober-sided classical-music critic.\nOne of the reasons why the appointment came as such a surprise, however, is that Gilbert is comparatively little known. Even Tommasini, who had advocated Gilbert’s appointment in the Times, calls him “an unpretentious musician with no air of the formidable conductor about him.” As a description of the next music director of an orchestra that has hitherto been led by musicians like Gustav Mahler and Pierre Boulez, that seems likely to have struck at least some Times readers as faint praise.\nFor my part, I have no idea whether Gilbert is a great conductor or even a good one. To be sure, he performs an impressive variety of interesting compositions, but it is not necessary for me to visit Avery Fisher Hall, or anywhere else, to hear interesting orchestral music. All I have to do is to go to my CD shelf, or boot up my computer and download still more recorded music from iTunes.\nDevoted concertgoers who reply that recordings are no substitute for live performance are missing the point. For the time, attention, and money of the art-loving public, classical instrumentalists must compete not only with opera houses, dance troupes, theater companies, and museums, but also with the recorded performances of the great classical musicians of the 20th century. There recordings are cheap, available everywhere, and very often much higher in artistic quality than today’s live performances; moreover, they can be “consumed” at a time and place of the listener’s choosing. The widespread availability of such recordings has thus brought about a crisis in the institution of the traditional classical concert.\nOne possible response is for classical performers to program attractive new music that is not yet available on record. Gilbert’s own interest in new music has been widely noted: Alex Ross, a classical-music critic, has described him as a man who is capable of turning the Philharmonic into “a markedly different, more vibrant organization.” But what will be the nature of that difference? Merely expanding the orchestra’s repertoire will not be enough. If Gilbert and the Philharmonic are to succeed, they must first change the relationship between America’s oldest orchestra and the new audience it hops to attract.\n　　21. We learn from Para.1 that Gilbert’s appointment has\n　　[A]incurred criticism.\n　　[B]raised suspicion.\n　　[C]received acclaim.\n　　[D]aroused curiosity.\n　　22. Tommasini regards Gilbert as an artist who is\n　　[A]influential.\n　　[B]modest.\n　　[C]respectable.\n　　[D]talented.\n　　23.

                    "question": "When Liam McGee departed as president of Bank of America in August, his explanation was surprisingly straight up. Rather than cloaking his exit in the usual vague excuses, he came right out and said he was leaving “to pursue my goal of running a company.” Broadcasting his ambition was “very much my decision,” McGee says. Within two weeks, he was talking for the first time with the board of Hartford Financial Services Group, which named him CEO and chairman on September 29.\nMcGee says leaving without a position lined up gave him time to reflect on what kind of company he wanted to run. It also sent a clear message to the outside world about his aspirations. And McGee isn’t alone. In recent weeks the No.2 executives at Avon and American Express quit with the explanation that they were looking for a CEO post. As boards scrutinize succession plans in response to shareholder pressure, executives who don’t get the nod also may wish to move on. A turbulent business environment also has senior managers cautious of letting vague pronouncements cloud their reputations.\nAs the first signs of recovery begin to take hold, deputy chiefs may be more willing to make the jump without a net. In the third quarter, CEO turnover was down 23% from a year ago as nervous boards stuck with the leaders they had, according to Liberum Research. As the economy picks up, opportunities will abound for aspiring leaders.\nThe decision to quit a senior position to look for a better one is unconventional. For years executives and headhunters have adhered to the rule that the most attractive CEO candidates are the ones who must be poached. Says Korn/Ferry senior partner Dennis Carey:”I can’t think of a single search I’ve done where a board has not instructed me to look at sitting CEOs first.”\nThose who jumped without a job haven’t always landed in top positions quickly. Ellen Marram quit as chief of Tropicana a decade age, saying she wanted to be a CEO. It was a year before she became head of a tiny Internet-based commodities exchange. Robert Willumstad left Citigroup in 2005 with ambitions to be a CEO. He finally took that post at a major financial institution three years later.\nMany recruiters say the old disgrace is fading for top performers. The financial crisis has made it more acceptable to be between jobs or to leave a bad one. “The traditional rule was it’s safer to stay where you are, but that’s been fundamentally inverted,” says one headhunter. “The people who’ve been hurt the worst are those who’ve stayed too long.”\n　　26. When McGee announced his departure, his manner can best be described as being\n　　[A]arrogant.\n　　[B]frank.\n　　[C]self-centered.\n　　[D]impulsive.\n　　27. According to Paragraph 2, senior executives’ quitting may be spurred by\n　　[A]their expectation of better financial status.\n　　[B]their need to reflect on their private life.\n　　[C]their strained relations with the boards.\n　　[D]their pursuit of new career goals.\n　　28. The word “poached” (Line 3, Paragraph 4) most probably means\n　　[A]approved of.\n　　[B]attended to.\n　　[C]hunted for.\n　　[D]guarded against.\n　　29. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that\n　　[A]top performers used to cling to their posts.\n　　[B]loyalty of top performers is getting out-dated.\n　　[C]top performers care more about reputations.\n　　[D]it’s safer to stick to the traditional rules.\n　　30.

                    "question": "The rough guide to marketing success used to be that you got what you paid for. No longer. While traditional “paid” media – such as television commercials and print advertisements – still play a major role, companies today can exploit many alternative forms of media. Consumers passionate about a product may create “owned” media by sending e-mail alerts about products and sales to customers registered with its Web site. The way consumers now approach the broad range of factors beyond conventional paid media.\nPaid and owned media are controlled by marketers promoting their own products. For earned media , such marketers act as the initiator for users’ responses. But in some cases, one marketer’s owned media become another marketer’s paid media – for instance, when an e-commerce retailer sells ad space on its Web site. We define such sold media as owned media whose traffic is so strong that other organizations place their content or e-commerce engines within that environment. This trend ,which we believe is still in its infancy, effectively began with retailers and travel providers such as airlines and hotels and will no doubt go further. Johnson & Johnson, for example, has created BabyCenter, a stand-alone media property that promotes complementary and even competitive products. Besides generating income, the presence of other marketers makes the site seem objective, gives companies opportunities to learn valuable information about the appeal of other companies’ marketing, and may help expand user traffic for all companies concerned.\nThe same dramatic technological changes that have provided marketers with more (and more diverse) communications choices have also increased the risk that passionate consumers will voice their opinions in quicker, more visible, and much more damaging ways. Such hijacked media are the opposite of earned media: an asset or campaign becomes hostage to consumers, other stakeholders, or activists who make negative allegations about a brand or product. Members of social networks, for instance, are learning that they can hijack media to apply pressure on the businesses that originally created them.\nIf that happens, passionate consumers would try to persuade others to boycott products, putting the reputation of the target company at risk. In such a case, the company’s response may not be sufficiently quick or thoughtful, and the learning curve has been steep. Toyota Motor, for example, alleviated some of the damage from its recall crisis earlier this year with a relatively quick and well-orchestrated social-media response campaign, which included efforts to engage with consumers directly on sites such as Twitter and the social-news site Digg.\n　　31.Consumers may create “earned” media when they are\n　　[A] obscssed with online shopping at certain Web sites.\n　　[B] inspired by product-promoting e-mails sent to them.\n　　[C] eager to help their friends promote quality products.\n　　[D] enthusiastic about recommending their favorite products.\n　　32. According to Paragraph 2,sold media feature\n　　[A] a safe business environment.\n　　[B] random competition.\n　　[C] strong user traffic.\n　　[D] flexibility in organization.\n　　33. The author indicates in Paragraph 3 that earned media\n　　[A] invite constant conflicts with passionate consumers.\n　　[B] can be used to produce negative effects in marketing.\n　　[C] may be responsible for fiercer competition.\n　　[D] deserve all the negative comments about them.\n　　34. Toyota Motor’s experience is cited as an example of\n　　[A] responding effectively to hijacked media.\n　　[B] persuading customers into boycotting products.\n　　[C] cooperating with supportive consumers.\n　　[D] taking advantage of hijacked media.\n　　35. Which of the following is the text mainly about ?\n　　[A] Alternatives to conventional paid media.\n　　[B] Conflict between hijacked and earned media.\n　　[C] Dominance of hijacked media.\n　　[D] Popularity of owned media."

                    "question": "It’s no surprise that Jennifer Senior’s insightful, provocative magazine cover story, “I love My Children, I Hate My Life,” is arousing much chatter – nothing gets people talking like the suggestion that child rearing is anything less than a completely fulfilling, life-enriching experience. Rather than concluding that children make parents either happy or miserable, Senior suggests we need to redefine happiness: instead of thinking of it as something that can be measured by moment-to-moment joy, we should consider being happy as a past-tense condition. Even though the day-to-day experience of raising kids can be soul-crushingly hard, Senior writes that “the very things that in the moment dampen our moods can later be sources of intense gratification and delight.”\nThe magazine cover showing an attractive mother holding a cute baby is hardly the only Madonna-and-child image on newsstands this week. There are also stories about newly adoptive – and newly single – mom Sandra Bullock, as well as the usual “Jennifer Aniston is pregnant” news. Practically every week features at least one celebrity mom, or mom-to-be, smiling on the newsstands.\nIn a society that so persistently celebrates procreation, is it any wonder that admitting you regret having children is equivalent to admitting you support kitten-killing ? It doesn’t seem quite fair, then, to compare the regrets of parents to the regrets of the children. Unhappy parents rarely are provoked to wonder if they shouldn’t have had kids, but unhappy childless folks are bothered with the message that children are the single most important thing in the world: obviously their misery must be a direct result of the gaping baby-size holes in their lives.\nOf course, the image of parenthood that celebrity magazines like Us Weekly and People present is hugely unrealistic, especially when the parents are single mothers like Bullock. According to several studies concluding that parents are less happy than childless couples, single parents are the least happy of all. No shock there, considering how much work it is to raise a kid without a partner to lean on; yet to hear Sandra and Britney tell it, raising a kid on their “own” (read: with round-the-clock help) is a piece of cake.\nIt’s hard to imagine that many people are dumb enough to want children just because Reese and Angelina make it look so glamorous: most adults understand that a baby is not a haircut. But it’s interesting to wonder if the images we see every week of stress-free, happiness-enhancing parenthood aren’t in some small, subconscious way contributing to our own dissatisfactions with the actual experience, in the same way that a small part of us hoped getting “ the Rachel” might make us look just a little bit like Jennifer Aniston.\n　　36.Jennifer Senior suggests in her article that raising a child can bring\n　　[A]temporary delight\n　　[B]enjoyment in progress\n　　[C]happiness in retrospect\n　　[D]lasting reward\n　　37.We learn from Paragraph 2 that\n　　[A]celebrity moms are a permanent source for gossip.\n　　[B]single mothers with babies deserve greater attention.\n　　[C]news about pregnant celebrities is entertaining.\n　　[D]having children is highly valued by the public.\n　　38.It is suggested in Paragraph 3 that childless folks\n　　[A]are constantly exposed to criticism.\n　　[B]are largely ignored by the media.\n　　[C]fail to fulfill their social responsibilities.\n　　[D]are less likely to be satisfied with their life.\n　　39.According to Paragraph 4, the message conveyed by celebrity magazines is\n　　[A]soothing.\n　　[B]ambiguous.\n　　[C]compensatory.\n　　[D]misleading.\n　　40.Which of the following can be inferred from the last paragraph?\n　　[A]Having children contributes little to the glamour of celebrity moms.\n　　[B]Celebrity moms have influenced our attitude towards child rearing.\n　　[C]Having children intensifies our dissatisfaction with life.\n　　[D]We sometimes neglect the happiness from child rearing."

These labels encourage style-conscious consumers to see clothes as disposable-meant to last only a wash or two, although they don’t advertise that –and to renew their wardrobe every few weeks. By offering on-trend items at dirt-cheap prices, Cline argues, these brands have hijacked fashion cycles, shaking an industry long accustomed to a seasonal pace.\nThe victims of this revolution, of course, are not limited to designers. For H&M to offer a $5.95 knit miniskirt in all its 2,300-pius stores around the world, it must rely on low-wage overseas labor, order in volumes that strain natural resources, and use massive amounts of harmful chemicals.\nOverdressed is the fashion world’s answer to consumer-activist bestsellers like Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dilemma. “Mass-produced clothing, like fast food, fills a hunger and need, yet is non-durable and wasteful,” Cline argues. Americans, she finds, buy roughly 20 billion garments a year – about 64 items per person – and no matter how much they give away, this excess leads to waste.\nTowards the end of Overdressed, Cline introduced her ideal, a Brooklyn woman named Sarah Kate Beaumont, who since 2008 has made all of her own clothes – and beautifully. But as Cline is the first to note, it took Beaumont decades to perfect her craft; her example can’t be knocked off.\nThough several fast-fashion companies have made efforts to curb their impact on labor and the environment – including H&M, with its green Conscious Collection line –Cline believes lasting change can only be effected by the customer. She exhibits the idealism common to many advocates of sustainability, be it in food or in energy. Vanity is a constant; people will only start shopping more sustainably when they can’t afford not to.\n　　21.

                    "question": "In order to “change lives for the better” and reduce “dependency,” George Orbome, Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced the “upfront work search” scheme. Only if the jobless arrive at the jobcentre with a CV register for online job search, and start looking for work will they be eligible for benefit-and then they should report weekly rather than fortnightly. What could be more reasonable?\nMore apparent reasonableness followed. There will now be a seven-day wait for the jobseeker’s allowance. “Those first few days should be spent looking for work, not looking to sign on.” he claimed. “We’re doing these things because we know they help people say off benefits and help those on benefits get into work faster” Help? Really? On first hearing, this was the socially concerned chancellor, trying to change lives for the better, complete with “reforms” to an obviously indulgent system that demands too little effort from the newly unemployed to find work, and subsides laziness. What motivated him, we were to understand, was his zeal for “fundamental fairness”-protecting the taxpayer, controlling spending and ensuring that only the most deserving claimants received their benefits.\nLosing a job is hurting: you don’t skip down to the jobcentre with a song in your heart, delighted at the prospect of doubling your income from the generous state. It is financially terrifying, psychologically embarrassing and you know that support is minimal and extraordinarily hard to get. You are now not wanted; you support is minimal and extraordinarily hard to get. You are now not wanted; you are now excluded from the work environment that offers purpose and structure in your life. Worse, the crucial income to feed yourself and your family and pay the bills has disappeared. Ask anyone newly unemployed what they want and the answer is always: a job.\nBut in Osborneland, your first instinct is to fall into dependency —permanent dependency if you can get it — supported by a state only too ready to indulge your falsehood. It is as though 20 years of ever-tougher reforms of the job search and benefit administration system never happened. The principle of British welfare is no longer that you can insure yourself against the risk of unemployment and receive unconditional payments if the disaster happens. Even the very phrase “jobseeker’s allowance” — invented in 1996 — is about redefining the unemployed as a “jobseeker” who had no mandatory right to a benefit he or she has earned through making national insurance contributions.Instead, the claimant receives a time-limited “allowance,” conditional on actively seeking a job; no entitlement and no insurance, at ￡71.70 a week, one of the least generous in the EU.\n　　21.George Osborne’s scheme was intended to\n　　[A]provide the unemployed with easier access to benefits.\n　　[B]encourage jobseekers’ active engagement in job seeking.\n　　[C]motivate the unemployed to report voluntarily.\n　　[D]guarantee jobseekers’ legitimate right to benefits.\n　　22.The phrase “to sign on”(Line 3,Para.2) most probably means\n　　[A]to check on the availability of jobs at the jobcentre.\n　　[B]to accept the government’s restrictions on the allowance.\n　　[C]to register for an allowance from the government.\n　　[D]to attend a governmental job-training program.\n　　22.The phrase “to sign on”(Line 3,Para.2) most probably means\n　　[A]to check on the availability of jobs at the jobcentre.\n　　[B]to accept the government’s restrictions on the allowance.\n　　[C]to register for an allowance from the government.\n　　[D]to attend a governmental job-training program.\n　　24.According to Paragraph 3, being unemployed makes one one feel\n　　[A]uneasy.\n　　[B]enraged.\n　　[C]insulted.\n　　[D]guilty.\n　　24.According to Paragraph 3, being unemployed makes one one feel\n　　[A]uneasy.\n　　[B]enraged.\n　　[C]insulted.\n　　[D]guilty."

                    "question": "All around the world, lawyers generate more hostility than the members of any other profession---with the possible exception of journalism. But there are few places where clients have more grounds for complaint than America.\nDuring the decade before the economic crisis, spending on legal services in America grew twice as fast as inflation. The best lawyers made skyscrapers-full of money, tempting ever more students to pile into law schools. But most law graduates never get a big-firm job. Many of them instead become the kind of nuisance-lawsuit filer that makes the tort system a costly nightmare.\nThere are many reasons for this. One is the excessive costs of a legal education. There is just one path for a lawyer in most American states: a four-year undergraduate degree at one of 200 law schools authorized by the American Bar Association and an expensive preparation for the bar exam. This leaves today’s average law-school graduate with $100,000 of debt on top of undergraduate debts. Law-school debt means that they have to work fearsomely hard.\nReforming the system would help both lawyers and their customers. Sensible ideas have been around for a long time, but the state-level bodies that govern the profession have been too conservative to implement them. One idea is to allow people to study law as an undergraduate degree. Another is to let students sit for the bar after only two years of law school. If the bar exam is truly a stern enough test for a would-be lawyer, those who can sit it earlier should be allowed to do so.Students who do not need the extra training could cut their debt mountain by a third.The other reason why costs are so high is the restrictive guild-like ownership structure of the business. Except in the District of Columbia, non-lawyers may not own any share of a law firm. This keeps fees high and innovation slow. There is pressure for change from within the profession, but opponents of change among the regulators insist that keeping outsiders out of a law firm isolates lawyers from the pressure to make money rather than serve clients ethically.\nIn fact,allowing non-lawyers to own shares in law firms would reduce costs and improve services to customers, by encouraging law firms to use technology and to employ professional managers to focus on improving firms’ efficiency. After all, other countries, such as Australia and Britain, have started liberalizing their legal professions. America should follow.\n　　26.a lot of students take up law as their profession due to\n　　[A]the growing demand from clients.\n　　[B]the increasing pressure of inflation.\n　　[C]the prospect of working in big firms.\n　　[D]the attraction of financial rewards.\n　　27.Which of the following adds to the costs of legal education in most American states?\n　　[A]Higher tuition fees for undergraduate studies.\n　　[B]Admissions approval from the bar association.\n　　[C]Pursuing a bachelor’s degree in another major.\n　　[D]Receiving training by professional associations.\n　　27.Which of the following adds to the costs of legal education in most American states?\n　　[A]Higher tuition fees for undergraduate studies.\n　　[B]Admissions approval from the bar association.\n　　[C]Pursuing a bachelor’s degree in another major.\n　　[D]Receiving training by professional associations.\n　　28.Hindrance to the reform of the legal system originates from\n　　[A]lawyers’ and clients’ strong resistance.\n　　[B]the rigid bodies governing the profession.\n　　[C]the stem exam for would-be lawyers.\n　　[D]non-professionals’ sharp criticism.\n　　28.Hindrance to the reform of the legal system originates from\n　　[A]lawyers’ and clients’ strong resistance.\n　　[B]the rigid bodies governing the profession.\n　　[C]the stem exam for would-be lawyers.\n　　[D]non-professionals’ sharp criticism.\n　　30.In this text, the author mainly discusses\n　　[A]flawed ownership of America’s law firms and its causes.\n　　[B]the factors that help make a successful lawyer in America.\n　　[C]a problem in America’s legal profession and solutions to it.\n　　[D]the role of undergraduate studies in America’s legal education."

                    "question": "The US$3-million Fundamental physics prize is indeed an interesting experiment, as Alexander Polyakov said when he accepted this year’s award in March. And it is far from the only one of its type. As a News Feature article in Nature discusses, a string of lucrative awards for researchers have joined the Nobel Prizes in recent years. Many, like the Fundamental Physics Prize, are funded from the telephone-number-sized bank accounts of Internet entrepreneurs. These benefactors have succeeded in their chosen fields, they say, and they want to use their wealth to draw attention to those who have succeeded in science.\nWhat’s not to like? Quite a lot, according to a handful of scientists quoted in the News Feature. You cannot buy class, as the old saying goes, and these upstart entrepreneurs cannot buy their prizes the prestige of the Nobels, The new awards are an exercise in self-promotion for those behind them, say scientists. They could distort the achievement-based system of peer-review-led research. They could cement the status quo of peer-reviewed research. They do not fund peer-reviewed research. They perpetuate the myth of the lone genius.\nThe goals of the prize-givers seem as scattered as the criticism.Some want to shock, others to draw people into science, or to better reward those who have made their careers in research.\nAs Nature has pointed out before, there are some legitimate concerns about how science prizes—both new and old—are distributed. The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, launched this year, takes an unrepresentative view of what the life sciences include.But the Nobel Foundation’s limit of three recipients per prize, each of whom must still be living, has long been outgrown by the collaborative nature of modern research—as will be demonstrated by the inevitable row over who is ignored when it comes to acknowledging the discovery of the Higgs boson. The Nobels were, of course,themselves set up by a very rich individual who had decided what he wanted to do with his own money. Time, rather than intention, has given them legitimacy.\nAs much as some scientists may complain about the new awards, two things seem clear. First, most researchers would accept such a prize if they were offered one. Second, it is surely a good thing that the money and attention come to science rather than go elsewhere, It is fair to criticize and question the mechanism—that is the culture of research, after all—but it is the prize-givers’ money to do with as they please. It is wise to take such gifts with gratitude and grace.\n　　31.The Fundamental Physical Prize is seen as\n　　[A]a symbol of the entrepreneurs’s wealth.\n　　[B]a possible replacement of the Nobel Prize.\n　　[C]an example of bankers’ investment.\n　　[D]a handsome reward for researchers.\n　　32.The phrase “to sign on”(Line 3,Para.2) most probably means\n　　[A]the profit-oriented scientists.\n　　[B]the founders of the new award.\n　　[C]the achievement-based system.\n　　[D]peer-review-led research.\n　　32.The phrase “to sign on”(Line 3,Para.2) most probably means\n　　[A]the profit-oriented scientists.\n　　[B]the founders of the new award.\n　　[C]the achievement-based system.\n　　[D]peer-review-led research.\n　　34.According to Paragraph 3, being unemployed makes one one feel\n　　[A]Their endurance has done justice to them.\n　　[B]Their legitimacy has long been in dispute.\n　　[C]They are the most representative honor.\n　　[D]History has never cast doubt on them.\n　　35.To which of the following would the author most probably agree?\n　　[A]acceptable despite the criticism.\n　　[B]harmful to the culture of research.\n　　[C]subject to undesirable changes.\n　　[D]unworthy of public attention."

                    "question": "“The Heart of the Matter,” the just-released report by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, deserves praise for affirming the importance of the humanities and social sciences to the prosperity and security of liberal democracy in America. Regrettably, however, the report's failure to address the true nature of the crisis facing liberal education may cause more harm than good.\nIn 2010, leading congressional Democrats and Republicans sent letters to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences asking that it identify actions that could be taken by \"federal, state and local governments, universities, foundations, educators, individual benefactors and others\" to \"maintain national excellence in humanities and social scientific scholarship and education.\"\nIn response, the American Academy formed the Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences, with Duke University President Richard Brodhead and retired Exelon CEO John Rowe as co-chairmen. Among the commission's 51 members are top-tier-university presidents, scholars, lawyers, judges, and business executives, as well as prominent figures from diplomacy, filmmaking, music and journalism.\nThe goals identified in the report are generally admirable. Because representative government presupposes an informed citizenry, the report supports full literacy; stresses the study of history and government, particularly American history and American government; and encourages the use of new digital technologies.\nTo encourage innovation and competition, the report calls for increased investment in research, the crafting of coherent curricula that improve students' ability to solve problems and communicate effectively in the 21st century, increased funding for teachers and the encouragement of scholars to bring their learning to bear on the great challenges of the day. The report also advocates greater study of foreign languages, international affairs and the expansion of study abroad programs.\nOne of the more novel ideas in the report is the creation of a \"Culture Corps\" in cities and town across America to \"transmit humanistic and social scientific expertise from one generation to the next.\"\nUnfortunately, despite 2? years in the making, \"The Heart of the Matter\" never gets to the heart of the matter: the illiberal nature of liberal education at our leading colleges and universities.\nThe commission ignores that for several decades America's colleges and universities have produced graduates who don't know the content and character of liberal education and are thus deprived of its benefits. Sadly, the spirit of inquiry once at home on campus has been replaced by the use of the humanities and social sciences as vehicles for disseminating \"progressive,\" or left-liberal propaganda.\nToday, professors routinely treat the progressive interpretation of history and progressive public policy as the proper subject of study while portraying conservative or classical liberal ideas—such as free markets, self-reliance and a distrust of central planning—as falling outside the boundaries of routine, and sometimes legitimate, intellectual investigation.\nThe AAAS displays great enthusiasm for liberal education. Yet its report may well set back reform by obscuring the depth and breadth of the challenge that congress asked it to illuminate.\n　　36. According to Paragraph 1, what is the author’s attitude toward the AAAS’s report?\n　　[A] Critical\n　　[B] Appreciative\n　　[C] Contemptuous\n　　[D] Tolerant\n　　37. Influential figures in the Congress required that the AAAS report on how to\n　　[A] retain people’s interest in liberal education\n　　[B] define the government’s role in education\n　　[C] keep a leading position in liberal education\n　　[D] safeguard individuals rights to education\n　　38. According to Paragraph 3, the report suggests\n　　[A] an exclusive study of American history\n　　[B] a greater emphasis on theoretical subjects\n　　[C] the application of emerging technologies\n　　[D] funding for the study of foreign languages\n　　39. The author implies in Paragraph S that professors are\n　　[A] supportive of free markets\n　　[B] cautious about intellectual investigation\n　　[C] conservative about public policy\n　　[D] biased against classical liberal ideas\n　　40. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?\n　　[A] Ways to Grasp “The Heart of the Matter”\n　　[B] Illiberal Education and “The Heart of the Matter”\n　　[C] The AAAS’s Contribution to Liberal Education\n　　[D] Progressive Policy vs. Liberal Education"

                    "question": "King Juan Carlos of Spain once insisted kings don’t abdicate, they die in their sleep. But embarrassing scandals and the popularity of the republican left in the recent Euro-elections have forced him to eat his words and stand down. So, dies the Spanish crisis suggest that monarchy is seeing its last days? Does that mean the uniting is on the wall for all European royals, with their magnificent uniforms and majestic lifestyles?\nThe Spanish case provides arguments both for and against monarchy when public opinion is particularly. Polarized, as it was following the end of the France regime, monarchs can rise above “mere” politics and “embody” a spirit of national unity.\nIt is this apparent transcendence of politics that explains monarchs continuing popularity as heads of states. And also, the Middle East expected, Europe is the most monarch-infested region is the world, with 10 kingdoms (not counting Vatican City and Andorra). But unlike their absolutist counterparts in the Gulf and Asia, most royal families have survived because they allow voters to avoid the difficult search for a non-controversial but respect public figure.\nEven so, kings and queens undoubtedly have a downside, symbolic of national unity as they claim to be, their very history—and sometimes the way they behave today-embodies outdated and indefensible privileges and inequalities. At a time when Thomas Piketty and other economists are warning of rising inequality and the increasing power of inherited wealth, it is bizarre that wealthy aristocratic families should still be the symbolic heart of modern democratic families should still be the symbolic heart of modern democratic states. The most successful monarchies strive to abandon or hide their old aristocratic ways. Prince and princess have day-jobs and ride bicycles, not horses (or helicopters). Even so, these are wealthy families who party with the international 1%, and media intrusiveness makes it increasingly difficult to maintain the right image.\nWhile Europe’s monarchies will no doubt be smart enough to strive for some time to come, it is the British royals who have most to fear from the Spanish example.\nIt is only the Queen who has preserved the monarchy reputation with her rather ordinary (if well-heeled) granny style. The danger will come with Charles, who has both an expensive taste of lifestyle and a pretty hierarchical view of the world. He has failed to understand that monarchies have largely survived because they provide a service—as non-controversial and non-political heads of state. Charles ought to know that as English history shows, it is kings of republicans, who are the monarchy’s worst enemies.\n　　21、according to the first two paragraphs, king Juan Carl of spain\n　　[A] used to enjoy high public support\n　　[B] was unpopular among European royals\n　　[C] ended his reign in embarrassment\n　　[D] cased his relationship with his rivals\n　　22、monarchs are kept as head of state in Europe mostly\n　　[A] owing to their undoubted and respectable status\n　　[B] to achieve a balance between tradition and reality\n　　[C] to give voters more public figures to look up to\n　　[D] due to their everlasting political embodiment\n　　23.

                    "question": "Just how much does the Constitution protect your digital data? The Supreme Court will now consider whether police can search the contents of a mobile phone without a warrant if the phone is on or around a person during an arrest.\nCalifornia has asked the justices to refrain from a sweeping ruling, particularly one that upsets the old assumptions that authorities may search through the possessions of suspects at the time of their arrest. It is hard, the state argues, for judges to assess the implications of new and rapidly changing technologies.\nThe court would be recklessly modest if it followed California’s advice. Enough of the implications are discernable, even obvious, so that the justice can and should provide updated guidelines to police, lawyers and defendants.\nThey should start by discarding California’s lame argument that exploring the contents of a smartphone- a vast storehouse of digital information is similar to say, going through a suspect’s purse .The court has ruled that police don't violate the Fourth Amendment when they go through the wallet or pocketbook, of an arrestee without a warrant. But exploring one’s smartphone is more like entering his or her home. A smartphone may contain an arrestee’s reading history, financial history, medical history and comprehensive records of recent correspondence. The development of “cloud computing.” meanwhile, has made that exploration so much the easier.\nBut the justices should not swallow California’s argument whole. New, disruptive technology sometimes demands novel applications of the Constitution’s protections. Orin Kerr, a law professor, compares the explosion and accessibility of digital information in the 21st century with the establishment of automobile use as a digital necessity of life in the 20th: The justices had to specify novel rules for the new personal domain of the passenger car then; they must sort out how the Fourth Amendment applies to digital information now.\n　　26. The Supreme Court, will work out whether, during an arrest, it is legitimate to\n　　[A] search for suspects’ mobile phones without a warrant.\n　　[B] check suspects’ phone contents without being authorized.\n　　[C] prevent suspects from deleting their phone contents.\n　　[D] prohibit suspects from using their mobile phones.\n　　27.

                    "question": "The journal Science is adding an extra round of statistical checks to its peer-review process, editor-in-chief Marcia McNutt announced today. The policy follows similar efforts from other journals, after widespread concern that basic mistakes in data analysis are contributing to the irreproducibility of many published research findings.\n“Readers must have confidence in the conclusions published in our journal,” writes McNutt in an editorial. Working with the American Statistical Association, the journal has appointed seven experts to a statistics board of reviewing editors (SBoRE). Manuscript will be flagged up for additional scrutiny by the journal’s internal editors, or by its existing Board of Reviewing Editors or by outside peer reviewers. The SBoRE panel will then find external statisticians to review these manuscripts.\nAsked whether any particular papers had impelled the change, McNutt said: “The creation of the ‘statistics board’ was motivated by concerns broadly with the application of statistics and data analysis in scientific research and is part of Science’s overall drive to increase reproducibility in the research we publish.”\nGiovanni Parmigiani, a biostatistician at the Harvard School of Public Health, a member of the SBoRE group, says he expects the board to “play primarily an advisory role.” He agreed to join because he “found the foresight behind the establishment of the SBoRE to be novel, unique and likely to have a lasting impact. This impact will not only be through the publications in Science itself, but hopefully through a larger group of publishing places that may want to model their approach after Science.”\nJohn Ioannidis, a physician who studies research methodology, says that the policy is “a most welcome step forward” and “long overdue.” “Most journals are weak in statistical review, and this damages are quality of what they publish. I think that, for the majority of scientific papers nowadays, statistical review is more essential than expert review,” he says. But he noted that biomedical journals such as Annals of Internal Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association and The Lancet pay strong attention to statistical review.\nProfessional scientists are expected to know how to analyze data, but statistical errors are alarmingly common in published research according to David Vaux a cell biologist. Researchers should improve their standards, he wrote in 2012, but journals should also take a tougher line, “engaging reviewers who are statistically literate and editors who can verify the process.” Vaux says that Science’s idea to pass some papers to statisticians “has some merit, but a weakness is that it relies on the board of reviewing editors to identify ‘the paper that need scrutiny’ in the first place.”\n　　31、It can be learned from Paragraph I that\n　　[A] Science intends to simplify its peer-review process.\n　　[B]journals are strengthening their statistical checks.\n　　[C]few journals are blamed for mistakes in data analysis.\n　　[D]lack of data analysis is common in research projects.\n　　32、The phrase “flagged up ”(Para.2)is the closest in meaning to\n　　[A]found.\n　　[B]revised.\n　　[C]marked\n　　[D]stored\n　　33、Giovanni Parmigiani believes that the establishment of the SBoRE may\n　　[A]pose a threat to all its peers\n　　[B]meet with strong opposition\n　　[C]increase Science’s circulation.\n　　[D]set an example for other journals\n　　34、David Vaux holds that what Science is doing now\n　　[A] adds to researchers’ workload.\n　　[B] diminishes the role of reviewers.\n　　[C] has room for further improvement.\n　　[D] is to fail in the foreseeable future.\n　　35.

                    "question": "Two years ago, Rupert Murdoch’s daughter, Elisabeth, spoke of the “unsettling dearth of integrity across so many of our institutions”. Integrity had collapsed, she argued, because of a collective acceptance that the only “sorting mechanism” in society should be profit and the market. But “it’s us, human beings, we the people who create the society we want, not profit”.\nDriving her point home, she continued: “It’s increasingly apparent that the absence of purpose, of a moral language within government, media or business could become one of the most dangerous goals for capitalism and freedom.” This same absence of moral purpose was wounding companies such as News International, she thought, making it more likely that it would lose its way as it had with widespread illegal telephone hacking.\nAs the hacking trial concludes—finding guilty one ex-editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, for conspiring to hack phones, and finding his predecessor, Rebekah Brooks, innocent of the same charge—the wider issue of dearth of integrity still stands. Journalists are known to have hacked the phones of up to 5,500 people. This is hacking on an industrial scale, as was acknowledged by Glenn Mulcaire, the man hired by the News of the World in 2001 to be the point person for phone hacking. Others await trial. This saga still unfolds.\nIn many respects, the dearth of moral purpose frames not only the fact of such widespread phone hacking but the terms on which the trial took place. One of the astonishing revelations was how little Rebekah Brooks knew of what went on in her newsroom, how little she thought to ask and the fact that she never inquired how the stories arrived. The core of her successful defence was that she knew nothing.\nIn today’s world, it has become normal that well-paid executives should not be accountable for what happens in the organisations that they run. Perhaps we should not be so surprised. For a generation, the collective doctrine has been that the sorting mechanism of society should be profit. The words that have mattered are efficiency, flexibility, shareholder value, business-friendly, wealth generation, sales, impact and, in newspapers, circulation. Words degraded to the margin have been justice, fairness, tolerance, proportionality and accountability.\nThe purpose of editing the News of the World was not to promote reader understanding, to be fair in what was written or to betray any common humanity. It was to ruin lives in the quest for circulation and impact. Ms Brooks may or may not have had suspicions about how her journalists got their stories, but she asked no questions, gave no instructions—nor received traceable, recorded answers.\n　　36. According to the first two paragraphs, Elisabeth was upset by\n　　(A) the consequences of the current sorting mechanism.\n　　(B) companies’ financial loss due to immoral practices\n　　(C) governmental ineffectiveness on moral issues.\n　　(D) the wide misuse of integrity among institutions.\n　　37. It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that\n　　(A) Glenn Mulcaire may deny phone hacking as a crime.\n　　(B) more journalists may be found guilty of phone hacking.\n　　(C) Andy Coulson should be held innocent of the charge.\n　　(D) phone hacking will be accepted on certain occasions.\n　　38. The author believes that Rebekah Brooks’s defence\n    (A) revealed a cunning personality.\n    (B) centered on trivial issues.\n    (C) was hardly convincing.\n    (D) was part of a conspiracy.\n    39.The author holds that the current collective doctrine shows_____.\n    (A) generally distorted values.\n    (B) unfair wealth distribution.\n    (C) a marginalized lifestyle.\n    (D) a rigid moral code.\n    40.Which of the following is suggested in the last paragraph?_____\n    (A) The quality of writings is of primary importance.\n    (B) Common humanity is central to news reporting.\n    (C) Moral awareness matters in editing a newspaper.\n    (D) Journalists need stricter industrial regulations."

                    "question": "France,which prides itself as the global innovator of fashion, has decided its fashion industry has lost an absolute right to define physical beauty for women. Its lawmakers gave preliminary approval last week to a law that would make it a crime to employ ultra-thin models on runways.\nThe parliament also agreed to ban websites that “incite excessive thinness” by promoting extreme dieting.\nSuch measures have a couple of uplifting motives. They suggest beauty should not be defined by looks that end up impinging on health. That’s a start. And the ban on ultra-thin models seems to go beyond protecting models from starving themselves to death—as some have done. It tells the fashion industry that it must take responsibility for the signal it sends women, especially teenage girls, about the social tape-measure they must use to determine their individual worth.\nThe bans, if fully enforced, would suggest to women (and many men) that they should not let others be arbiters of their beauty. And perhaps faintly, they hint that people should look to intangible qualities like character and intellect rather than dieting their way to size zero or wasp-waist physiques.\nThe French measures, however, rely too much on severe punishment to change a culture that still regards beauty as skin-deep—and bone-showing. Under the law, using a fashion model that does not meet a government-defined index of body mass could result in a $85,000 fine and six months in prison.\nThe fashion industry knows it has an inherent problem in focusing on material adornment and idealized body types. In Denmark, the United States, and a few other countries, it is trying to set voluntary standards for models and fashion images that rely more on peer pressure for enforcement.\nIn contrast to France’s actions, Denmark’s fashion industry agreed last month on rules and sanctions regarding the age, health, and other characteristics of models. The newly revised Danish Fashion Ethical Charter clearly states: “We are aware of and take responsibility for the impact the fashion industry has on body ideals, especially on young people.” The charter’s main tool of enforcement is to deny access for designers and modeling agencies to Copenhagen Fashion Week, which is run by the Danish Fashion Institute.

                    "question": "For the first time in history more people live in towns than in the country. In Britain this has had a curious result. While polls show Britons rate “the countryside” alongside the royal family, Shakespeare and the National Health Service (NHS) as what makes them proudest of their country, this has limited political support.\nA century ago Octavia Hill launched the National Trust not to rescue stylish houses but to save “the beauty of natural places for everyone forever.” It was specifically to provide city dwellers with spaces for leisure where they could experience “a refreshing air.” Hill’s pressure later led to the creation of national parks and green belts. They don’t make countryside any more, and every year concrete consumes more of it. It needs constant guardianship.\nAt the next election none of the big parties seem likely to endorse this sentiment. The Conservatives’ planning reform explicitly gives rural development priority over conservation, even authorizing “off-plan” building where local people might object. The concept of sustainable development has been defined as profitable. Labour likewise wants to discontinue local planning where councils oppose development. The Liberal Democrats are silent. Only Ukip, sensing its chance, has sided with those pleading for a more considered approach to using green land. Its Campaign to Protect Rural England struck terror into many local Consecutive parties.\nThe sensible place to build new houses, factories and offices is where people are, in cities and towns where infrastructure is in place. The London agents Stirling Ackroyd recently identified enough sites for half a million houses in the London are alone, with no intrusion on green bet. What is true of London is even truer of the provinces.\nThe idea that “housing crisis” equals “concreted meadows” is pure lobby talk. The issue is not the need for more houses but, as always, where to put them. Under lobby pressure, George Osborne favours rural new-build against urban renovation and renewal. He favours out-of-town shopping sites against high streets. This is not a free market but a biased one. Rural towns and villages have grown and will always grow. They do so best where building sticks to their edges and respects their character. We do not ruin urban conservation areas. Why ruin rural ones?\nDevelopment should be planned, not let rip. After the Netherlands, Britain is Europe’s most crowded country. Half a century of town and country planning has enabled it to retain an enviable rural coherence, while still permitting low-density urban living. There is no doubt of the alternative—the corrupted landscapes of southern Portugal, Spain or Ireland. Avoiding this rather than promoting it should unite the left and right of the political spectrum.\n　　26.Britain’s public sentiment about the countryside\n　　[A] didn’t start till the Shakespearean age.\n　　[B] has brought much benefit to the NHS.\n　　[C] is fully backed by the royal family.\n　　[D] is not well reflected in politics.\n　　27.According to Paragraph 2, the achievements of the National Trust are now be\n　　[A] gradually destroyed.\n　　[B] effectively reinforced.\n　　[C] largely overshadowed.\n　　[D] properly protected.\n　　28.Which of the following can be inferred from Paragraph 3?\n　　[A] Labour is under attack for opposing development.\n　　[B] The Conservatives may abandon “off-plan” building.\n　　[C] The Liberal Democrats are losing political influence.\n　　[D] Ukip may gain from its support for rural conservation.\n　　29.The author holds that George Osborne’s preference\n　　[A] highlights his firm stand against lobby pressure.\n　　[B] shows his disregard for the character of rural areas.\n　　[C] stresses the necessity f easing the housing crisis.\n　　[D] reveals a strong prejudice against urban areas.\n　　30.In the last paragraph, the author shows his appreciation of\\\n　　[A] the size of population in Britain.\n　　[B] the political life in today’s Britain.\n　　[C] the enviable urban lifestyle in Britain.\n　　[D] the town-and-country planning in Britain."

                    "question": "“There is one and only one social responsibility of businesses,” Wrote Milton Friedman, a Nobel prize-winning economist, “That is,to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profit”. But even if you accept Firedman’s premise and regard corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies as waste of shareholders’ money, things may not be absolutely clear-cut. New research suggest the CSR may create monetary value for companies-at least when they are prosecuted for corruption.\nThe largest firms in America and Britain together spend more than $15 billion a year on CSR,according to an estimate by EPG, a consulting firm.This could add value to their businesses in three ways. First, consumers may take CSR spending as a “signal” that a company’s products are of high quality. Second, customers may be willing to buy a company’s products as an indirect way to donate to the good causes it helps.And third, through a more diffuse “halo effect,” whereby its good deeds earn it greater consideration from consumers and others.\nPrevious studies on CSR have had trouble differentiating these effects because consumers can be affected by all three. A recent study attempts to separate them by looking at bribery prosecutions under America’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). It argues that since prosecutors do not consume a company’s products as part of their investigations, they could be influenced only by the halo effect.\nThe study found that, among prosecuted firms, those with the most comprehensive CSR programmes tended to get more lenient penalties. Their analysis ruled out the possibility that it was firms’ political influence, rather than their CSR stand, that accounted for the leniency: Companies that contributed more to political campaigns did not receive lower fines.\nIn all, the study concludes that whereas prosecutors should only evaluate a case based on its merits, they do seem to be influenced by a company’s record in CSR. “We estimate that either eliminating a substantial labour-rights concern, such as child labour, or increasing corporate giving by about 20% results in fines that generally are 40% lower than the typical punishment for briding foreign officials,” says one researcher.\nResearchers admit that their study does not answer the question of how much businesses ought to spend on CSR. Nor does it reveal how much companies are banking on the halo effect, rather than the other possible benefits, when they decide their do-gooding policies. But at least they have demonstrated that when companies get into trouble with the law, evidence of good character can win them a less costly punishment.\n　　31.

                    "question": "There will eventually come a day when The New York Times ceases to publish stories on newsprint. Exactly when that day will be is a matter of debate. “Sometime in the future，”the paper’s publisher said back in 2010.\nNostalgia for ink on paper and the rustle of pages aside，there’s plenty of incentive to ditch print. The infrastructure required to make a physical newspaper-printing presses, delivery trucks—isn’t just expensive; it’s excessive at a time when online-only competitors don’t have the same set of financial constraints. Readers are migrating away from print anyway. And though print ad sales still dwarf their online and mobile counterparts, revenue from print is still declining.\nOverhead may be high and circulation lower, but rushing to eliminate its print edition would be a mistake, says BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti.\nPeretti says the Times should’t waste time getting out of the print business, but only if they go about doing it the right way. “Figuring out a way to accelerate that transition would make sense for them,” he said, “but if you discontinue it, you’re going to have your most loyal customers really upset with you.”\nSometimes that’s worth making a change anyway. Peretti gives the example of Netflix discontinuing its DVD-mailing service to focus on streaming. “It was seen as a blunder,” he said. The move turned out to be foresighted. And if Peretti were in charge at the Times? “I wouldn’t pick a year to end print,” he said. “I would raise prices and make it into more of a legacy product.”\nThe most loyal customers would still get the product they favor, the idea goes, and they’d feel like they were helping sustain the quality of something they believe in. “So if you’re overpaying for print, you could feel like you were helping,” Peretti said. “Then increase it at a higher rate each year and essentially try to generate additional revenue.” In other words, if you’re going to make a print product, make it for the people who are already obsessed with it. Which may be what the Times is doing already. Getting the print edition seven days a week costs nearly $500 a year—more than twice as mush as a digital-only subscription.\n“It’s a really hard thing to do and it’s a tremendous luxury that BuzzFeed doesn’t have a legacy business,” Peretti remarked. “But we’re going to have questions like that where we have things we’re doing that don’t make sense when the market changes and the world changes. In those situations, it’s better to be more aggressive than less aggressive.”\n　　36.The New York Times is considering ending its print edition partly due\n　　[A] the high cost of operation.\n　　[B] the pressure from its investors.\n　　[C] the complaints from its readers.\n　　[D] the increasing online ad sales.\n　　37. Peretti suggests that, in face of the present situation, the Times should\n　　[A] seek new sources of readership.\n　　[B] end the print edition for good.\n　　[C] aim for efficient management.\n　　[D] make strategic adjustments.\n　　38.It can be inferred from Paragraphs 5 and 6 that a “legacy product”\n　　[A] helps restore the glory of former times.\n　　[B] is meant for the most loyal customers.\n　　[C] will have the cost of printing reduced.\n　　[D] expands the popularity of the paper.\n　　39.Peretti believes that, in a changing world.\n　　[A] legacy businesses are becoming outdated.\n　　[B] cautiousness facilitates problem-solving.\n　　[C] aggressiveness better meets challenges.\n　　[D] traditional luxuries can stay unaffected.\n　　40.Which of the following would be the best title of the text?\n　　[A] Shift to Online Newspapers All at Once\n　　[B] Cherish the Newspaper Still in Your Hand\n　　[C] Make Your Print Newspaper a Luxury Good\n　　[D] Keep Your Newspapers Forever in Fashion"

                    "question": "First two hours, now three hours - this is how far in advance authorities are recommending people show up to catch a domestic flight, at least at some major U.S. airports with increasingly massive security lines.\nAmericans are willing to tolerate time-consuming security procedures in return for increased safety. The crash of EgyptAir Flight 804, which terrorists may have downed over the Mediterranean Sea, provides another tragic reminder of why. But demanding too much of air travelers or providing too little security in return undermines public support for the process. And it should: Wasted time is a drag on Americans’ economic and private lives, not to mention infuriating.\nLast year, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) found in a secret check that undercover investigators were able to sneak weapons - both fake and real - past airport security nearly every time they tried. Enhanced security measures since then, combined with a rise in airline travel due to the improving economy and low oil prices, have resulted in long waits at major airports such as Chicago’s O'Hare International. It is not yet clear how much more effective airline security has become - but the lines are obvious.\nPart of the issue is that the government did not anticipate the steep increase in airline travel, so the TSA is now rushing to get new screeners on the line. Part of the issue is that airports have only so much room for screening lanes. Another factor may be that more people are trying to overpack their carry-on bags to avoid checked-baggage fees, though the airlines strongly dispute this.\nThere is one step the TSA could take that would not require remodeling airports or rushing to hire: Enroll more people in the PreCheck program. PreCheck is supposed to be a win-win for travelers and the TSA. Passengers who pass a background check are eligible to use expedited screening lanes. This allows the TSA to focus on travelers who are higher risk, saving time for everyone involved. The TSA wants to enroll 25 million people in PreCheck.\nIt has not gotten anywhere close to that, and one big reason is sticker shock: Passengers must pay $85 every five years to process their background checks. Since the beginning, this price tag has been PreCheck’s fatal flaw. Upcoming reforms might bring the price to a more reasonable level. But Congress should look into doing so directly, by helping to finance PreCheck enrollment or to cut costs in other ways.\nThe TSA cannot continue diverting resources into underused PreCheck lanes while most of the traveling public suffers in unnecessary line's. It is long past time o make the program work.\n　　21.

Sadly, all is not well with astronomy in Hawaii today. Protesters have erupt of over construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope(TMT), a giantobservatory that promises to revolutionize humanity’s view of cosmos.\nAt the issue is the TMT’s planned location on Mauna Kea, a domant volcano worshiped by hsome Hawaiian aspoko, that connects the Hawaiian Island to the heavens. But Mauna Kea is also home to some of the world’s most powerful telescopes. Rested in thePercific Ocean, Mauna Kea’s peak rises above the bulk of our planet’s dense atmosphere, where conditions allow telescopes to obtain images of surpassed clarity.\nOppositions to telescopes on Mauna Kea is nothing new. A small but vocal group of Hawaiians and environmentalists have long viewed their presence as disrespect for sacred land and a painful reminder of occupation of what was ones a sovereign nation.\nSome blame for the current controversy belongs to astronomers. In their eagerness to built bigger telescopes, they forgot that science is not the only way for understanding the world. They did not always prioritize the protection of Mauna Kea’s fragile ecosystems or its holiness to the islands’ inhabitants. Hawaiian culture is not the relic of the past; it is a living culture undergoing a renaissance today.\nYet science has a culture history, too, which roots going back to the dawn of civilization. The same curiosity to find what lies beyond the horizon that first brought clearly Polynesians to Hawaii’s shores inspires astronomers today to explore the heavens. Calls to disassemble all telescopes on Mauna Kea or to ban both seek to answer big questions about who we are, where we come from and where we are going. Perhaps that is why we explore the starry skies. As if answering a primary calling to know ourselves and our true ancestral homes.\nThe astronomy community is making comprises to change its use of Mauna Kea. The TMT site was chosen to minimize the telescope’s visibility around the island and to avoid archaeological and environmental impact. To limit the number of telescopes on Mauna Kea, old ones will be removed at the end of their lifetimes and their sites retuned to a natural state.

                    "question": "Robert F. Kennedy once said that a country’s GDP measures “everything except that which makes life worthwhile.” With Britain voting to leave the European Union, and GDP already predicted to slow as a result, it is now a timely moment to assess what he was referring to.\nThe question of GDP and its usefulness has annoyed policymakers for over half a century. Many argue that it is a flawed concept. It measures things that do not matter and miss things that do. By most recent measures, the UK’s GDP has been the envy of the Western World, with record low unemployment and high growth figures. If everything was going so so well, then why did over 17million people vote for Brexit, despite the warnings about what it could do to their country’s economic prospects?\nA recent annual study of countries and their ability to convert growth into well-being sheds some light on that question. Across the 163 countries measured, the UK is one of the poorest performers in ensuring that economic growth is translated into meaningful improvement for its citizens. Rather than just focusing on GDP, over 40 different sets of criteria from health, education and civil society engagement have been measured to get a more rounded assessment of how countries are performing.\nWhile all of these countries face their own challenges, there are a number of consistent themes. Yes, there has been a budding economic recovery since the 2008 global crash, but in key indicators in areas such as health and education, major economies have continued to decline. Yet this isn’t the case with all countries. Some relatively poor European countries have seen huge improvements across measures including civil society, income equality and the environment.\nThis is a lesson that rich countries can learn: When GDP is no longer regarded as the sole measure of a country’s success, the world looks very different.\nSo, what Kennedy was referring to was that while GDP h as been the most common method for measuring the economic activity of nations, as a measure, it is no longer enough. It does not include important factors such as environmental equality or education outcomes - all things that contribute to a person’s sense of well-being.\nThe sharp hit to growth predicted around the world and in the UK could lead to a decline in the everyday services we depend on for our well-being and for growth. But policymaker who refocus efforts on improving well-being rather than simply worrying about GDP figures could avoid the forecasted doom and may even see progress.\n　　31. Robert F. Kennedy is cited because he\n　　A praised the UK for its GDP.\n　　B identified GDP with happiness.\n　　C misinterpreted the role of GDP.\n　　D had a low opinion of GDP.\n　　32.

                    "question": "In a rare unanimous ruling, the US Supreme Court has overturned the corruption conviction of a former Virginia governor, Robert McDonnell.But it did so while holding its nose at the ethics of his conduct, which included accepting gifts such as a Rolex watch and a Ferrari automobile from a company seeking access to government.\nThe high court’s decision said the judge in Mr.McDonnell’s trail failed to tell a jury that it must look only at his “official acts”, or the former governor’s decisions on “specific” and “unsettled” issues related to his duties.\nMerely helping a gift-giver gain access to other officials, unless done with clear intent to pressure those officials, is not corruption, the justices found.\nThe court did suggest that accepting favors in return for opening doors is “distasteful” and “nasty”. But under anti-bribery laws, proof must be made of concrete benefits, such as approval of a contract or regulation. Simply arranging a meeting, making a phone call, or hosting an event is not an an “official act”.\nThe court’s ruling is legally sound in defining a kind of favoritism that is not criminal. Elected leaders must be allowed to help supporters deal with bureaucratic problems without fear of prosecution for bribery. “The basic compact underlying representative government,” wrote Chief Justice John Robert for the court, “assumes that public officials will hear from their constituents and act on their concerns.”\nBut the ruling reinforces the need for citizens and their elected representatives, not the courts, to ensure equality of access to government. Officials must not be allowed to play favorites in providing information or in arranging meetings simply because an individual or group provides a campaign donation or a personal gift. This type of integrity requires well-enforced laws in government transparency, such as records of official meetings, rules on lobbying, and information about each elected leader’s sources of wealth.\nFavoritism in official access can fan public perceptions of corruption. But it is not always corruption.Rather officials must avoid double standards, or different types of access for average people and the wealthy. If connections can be bought, a basic premise of democratic society---that all are equal in treatment by government---is undermined. Good governance rests on an understanding of the inherent worth of each individual.\nThe court’s ruling is a step forward in the struggle against both corruption and official favoritism.\n　　36.The underlined sentence(Para.1) most probably shows that the court\n　　A avoided defining the extent of McDonnell’s duties.\n　　B made no compromise in convicting McDonnell.\n　　C was contemptuous of McDonnell’s conduct.\n　　D refused to comment on McDonnell’s ethics.\n　　37 According to Paragraph 4, an official act is deemed corruptive only if it involves\n　　A concrete returns for gift-givers.\n　　B sizable gains in the form of gifts.\n　　C leaking secrets intentionally.\n　　D breaking contracts officially.\n　　38 The court’s ruling is based on the assumption that public officials are\n　　A allowed to focus on the concerns of their supporters.\n　　B qualified to deal independently with bureaucratic issues.\n　　C justified in addressing the needs of their constituents.\n　　D exempt from conviction on the charge of favoritism.\n　　39Well-enforced laws in government transparency are needed to\n　　A awaken the conscience of officials.\n　　B guarantee fair play in official access.\n　　Callow for certain kinds of lobbying.\n　　D inspire hopes in average people.\n　　40 The author’s attitude toward the court’s ruling is\n　　A sarcastic.\n　　B tolerant.\n　　C skeptical\n　　D supportive"

                    "question": "Among the annoying challenges facing the middle class is one that will probably go unmentioned in the next presidential campaign: What happens when the robots come for their jobs?\nDon't dismiss that possibility entirely. About half of U.S. jobs are at high risk of being automated, according to a University of Oxford study, with the middle class disproportionately squeezed. Lower-income jobs like gardening or day care don't appeal to robots. But many middle-class occupations-trucking, financial advice, software engineering — have aroused their interest, or soon will. The rich own the robots, so they will be fine.\nThis isn't to be alarmist. Optimists point out that technological upheaval has benefited workers in the past. The Industrial Revolution didn't go so well for Luddites whose jobs were displaced by mechanized looms, but it eventually raised living standards and created more jobs than it destroyed. Likewise, automation should eventually boost productivity, stimulate demand by driving down prices, and free workers from hard, boring work. But in the medium term, middle-class workers may need a lot of help adjusting.\nThe first step, as Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue in The Second Machine Age, should be rethinking education and job training. Curriculums —from grammar school to college- should evolve to focus less on memorizing facts and more on creativity and complex communication. Vocational schools should do a better job of fostering problem-solving skills and helping students work alongside robots. Online education can supplement the traditional kind. It could make extra training and instruction affordable. Professionals trying to acquire new skills will be able to do so without going into debt.\nThe challenge of coping with automation underlines the need for the U.S. to revive its fading business dynamism: Starting new companies must be made easier. In previous eras of drastic technological change, entrepreneurs smoothed the transition by dreaming up ways to combine labor and machines. The best uses of 3D printers and virtual reality haven't been invented yet. The U.S. needs the new companies that will invent them.\nFinally, because automation threatens to widen the gap between capital income and labor income, taxes and the safety net will have to be rethought. Taxes on low-wage labor need to be cut, and wage subsidies such as the earned income tax credit should be expanded: This would boost incomes, encourage work, reward companies for job creation, and reduce inequality.\nTechnology will improve society in ways big and small over the next few years, yet this will be little comfort to those who find their lives and careers upended by automation.\nDestroying the machines that are coming for our jobs would be nuts. But policies to help workers adapt will be indispensable.\n    21.Who will be most threatened by automation?\n    [A] Leading politicians.\n    [B]Low-wage laborers.\n    [C]Robot owners.\n    [D]Middle-class workers.\n    22 .Which of the following best represent the author’s view?\n    [A] Worries about automation are in fact groundless.\n    [B]Optimists' opinions on new tech find little support.\n    [C]Issues arising from automation need to be tackled\n    [D]Negative consequences of new tech can be avoided\n    23.Education in the age of automation should put more emphasis on\n    [A] creative potential.\n    [B]job-hunting skills.\n    [C]individual needs.\n    [D]cooperative spirit.\n    24.The author suggests that tax policies be aimed at\n    [A] encouraging the development of automation.\n    [B]increasing the return on capital investment.\n    [C]easing the hostility between rich and poor.\n    [D]preventing the income gap from widening.\n    25.In this text, the author presents a problem with\n    [A] opposing views on it.\n    [B]possible solutions to it.\n    [C]its alarming impacts.\n    [D]its major variations."

                    "question": "A new survey by Harvard University finds more than two-thirds of young Americans disapprove of President Trump’s use of Twitter. The implication is that Millennials prefer news from the White House to be filtered through other source, Not a president’s social media platform.\nMost Americans rely on social media to check daily headlines. Yet as distrust has risen toward all media, people may be starting to beef up their media literacy skills. Such a trend is badly needed. During the 2016 presidential campaign, nearly a quarter of web content shared by Twitter users in the politically critical state of Michigan was fake news, according to the University of Oxford. And a survey conducted for BuzzFeed News found 44 percent of Facebook users rarely or never trust news from the media giant.\nYoung people who are digital natives are indeed becoming more skillful at separating fact from fiction in cyberspace. A Knight Foundation focus-group survey of young people between ages 14and24 found they use “distributed trust” to verify stories. They cross-check sources and prefer news from different perspectives—especially those that are open about any bias. “Many young people assume a great deal of personal responsibility for educating themselves and actively seeking out opposing viewpoints,” the survey concluded.\nSuch active research can have another effect. A 2014 survey conducted in Australia, Britain, and the United States by the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that young people’s reliance on social media led to greater political engagement.\nSocial media allows users to experience news events more intimately and immediately while also permitting them to re-share news as a projection of their values and interests. This forces users to be more conscious of their role in passing along information. A survey by Barna research group found the top reason given by Americans for the fake news phenomenon is “reader error,” more so than made-up stories or factual mistakes in reporting. About a third say the problem of fake news lies in “misinterpretation or exaggeration of actual news” via social media. In other words, the choice to share news on social media may be the heart of the issue. “This indicates there is a real personal responsibility in counteracting this problem,” says Roxanne Stone, editor in chief at Barna Group.\nSo when young people are critical of an over-tweeting president, they reveal a mental discipline in thinking skills – and in their choices on when to share on social media.\n    26. According to the Paragraphs 1 and 2, many young Americans cast doubts on\n    [A] the justification of the news-filtering practice.\n    [B] people’s preference for social media platforms.\n    [C] the administrations ability to handle information.\n    [D] social media was a reliable source of news.\n    27.

                    "question": "Any fair-minded assessment of the dangers of the deal between Britain's National Health Service (NHS) and DeepMind must start by acknowledging that both sides mean well. DeepMind is one of the leading artificial intelligence (AI) companies in the world. The potential of this work applied to healthcare is very great, but it could also lead to further concentration of power in the tech giants. It Is against that background that the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has issued her damning verdict against the Royal Free hospital trust under the NHS, which handed over to DeepMind the records of 1.6 million patients In 2015 on the basis of a vague agreement which took far too little account of the patients' rights and their expectations of privacy.\nDeepMind has almost apologized. The NHS trust has mended its ways. Further arrangements- and there may be many-between the NHS and DeepMind will be carefully scrutinised to ensure that all necessary permissions have been asked of patients and all unnecessary data has been cleaned. There are lessons about informed patient consent to learn. But privacy is not the only angle in this case and not even the most important. Ms Denham chose to concentrate the blame on the NHS trust, since under existing law it “controlled” the data and DeepMind merely “processed\" it. But this distinction misses the point that it is processing and aggregation, not the mere possession of bits, that gives the data value.\nThe great question is who should benefit from the analysis of all the data that our lives now generate. Privacy law builds on the concept of damage to an individual from identifiable knowledge about them. That misses the way the surveillance economy works. The data of an individual there gains its value only when it is compared with the data of countless millions more.\nThe use of privacy law to curb the tech giants in this instance feels slightly maladapted. This practice does not address the real worry. It is not enough to say that the algorithms DeepMind develops will benefit patients and save lives. What matters is that they will belong to a private monopoly which developed them using public resources. If software promises to save lives on the scale that dugs now can, big data may be expected to behave as a big pharm has done. We are still at the beginning of this revolution and small choices now may turn out to have gigantic consequences later. A long struggle will be needed to avoid a future of digital feudalism. Ms Denham's report is a welcome start.\n    31.Wha is true of the agreement between the NHS and DeepMind ?\n    [A] It caused conflicts among tech giants.\n    [B] It failed to pay due attention to patient’s rights.\n    [C] It fell short of the latter's expectations\n    [D] It put both sides into a dangerous situation.\n    32. The NHS trust responded to Denham's verdict with\n    [A] empty promises.\n    [B] tough resistance.\n    [C] necessary adjustments.\n    [D] sincere apologies.\n    33.The author argues in Paragraph 2 that\n    [A] privacy protection must be secured at all costs.\n    [B] leaking patients' data is worse than selling it.\n    [C] making profits from patients' data is illegal.\n    [D] the value of data comes from the processing of it\n    34.According to the last paragraph, the real worry arising from this deal is\n    [A] the vicious rivalry among big pharmas.\n    [B] the ineffective enforcement of privacy law.\n    [C] the uncontrolled use of new software.\n    [D] the monopoly of big data by tech giants.\n    35.The author's attitude toward the application of AI to healthcare is\n    [A] ambiguous.\n    [B] cautious.\n    [C] appreciative.\n    [D] contemptuous."

                    "question": "The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) continues to bleed red ink. It reported a net loss of $5.6 billion for fiscal 2016, the 10th straight year its expenses have exceeded revenue. Meanwhile, it has more than $120 billion in unfunded liabilities, mostly for employee health and retirement costs. There are many bankruptcies. Fundamentally, the USPS is in a historic squeeze between technological change that has permanently decreased demand for its bread-and-butter product, first-class mail, and a regulatory structure that denies management the flexibility to adjust its operations to the new reality\nAnd interest groups ranging from postal unions to greeting-card makers exert self-interested pressure on the USPS’s ultimate overseer-Congress-insisting that whatever else happens to the Postal Service, aspects of the status quo they depend on get protected. This is why repeated attempts at reform legislation have failed in recent years, leaving the Postal Service unable to pay its bills except by deferring vital modernization.\nNow comes word that everyone involved---Democrats, Republicans, the Postal Service, the unions and the system's heaviest users—has finally agreed on a plan to fix the system. Legislation is moving through the House that would save USPS an estimated $28.6 billion over five years, which could help pay for new vehicles, among other survival measures. Most of the money would come from a penny-per-letter permanent rate increase and from shifting postal retirees into Medicare. The latter step would largely offset the financial burden of annually pre-funding retiree health care, thus addressing a long-standing complaint by the USPS and its union.\nIf it clears the House, this measure would still have to get through the Senate – where someone is bound to point out that it amounts to the bare, bare minimum necessary to keep the Postal Service afloat, not comprehensive reform. There’s no change to collective bargaining at the USPS, a major omission considering that personnel accounts for 80 percent of the agency’s costs. Also missing is any discussion of eliminating Saturday letter delivery. That common-sense change enjoys wide public support and would save the USPS $2 billion per year. But postal special-interest groups seem to have killed it, at least in the House. The emerging consensus around the bill is a sign that legislators are getting frightened about a politically embarrassing short-term collapse at the USPS. It is not, however, a sign that they’re getting serious about transforming the postal system for the 21st century.\n    36.The financial problem with the USPS is caused partly by\n    [A]. its unbalanced budget.\n    [B] .its rigid management.\n    [C] .the cost for technical upgrading.\n    [D]. the withdrawal of bank support.\n    37. According to Paragraph 2, the USPS fails to modernize itself due to\n    [A]. the interference from interest groups.\n    [B] .the inadequate funding from Congress.\n    [C] .the shrinking demand for postal service.\n    [D] .the incompetence of postal unions.\n    38.The long-standing complaint by the USPS and its unions can be addressed by\n    [A] .removing its burden of retiree health care.\n    [B] .making more investment in new vehicles.\n    [C] .adopting a new rate-increase mechanism.\n    [D]. attracting more first-class mail users.\n    39.In the last paragraph, the author seems to view legislators with\n    [A] respect.\n    [B] tolerance.\n    [C] discontent.\n    [D] gratitude.\n    40.Which of the following would be the best title for the text?\n    [A] The USPS Starts to Miss Its Good Old Days\n    [B] The Postal Service: Keep Away from My Cheese\n    [C] The USPS: Chronic Illness Requires a Quick Cure\n    [D] The Postal Service Needs More than a Band-Aid"

                    "question": "Unlike so-called basic emotions such as sadness, fear, and anger, guilt emerges a little later, in conjunction with a child's growing grasp of social and moral norms. Children aren't born knowing how to say \"I'm sorry”; rather, they learn over time that such statements appease parents and friends - and their own consciences. This is why researchers generally regard so-called moral guilt, in the right amount, to be a good thing.\nIn the popular imagination, of course, guilt still gets a bad rap. It is deeply uncomfortable - it's the emotional equivalent of wearing a jacket weighted with stones. Yet this understanding is outdated. \"There has been a kind of revival or a rethinking about what guilt is and what role guilt can serve,\" says Amrisha Vaish, a psychology researcher at the University of Virginia, adding that this revival is part of a larger recognition that emotions aren't binary -feelings that may be advantageous in one context may be harmful in another. Jealousy and anger, for example, may have evolved to alert us to important inequalities. Too much happiness can be destructive.\nAnd guilt, by prompting us to think more deeply about our goodness, can encourage humans to make up for errors and fix relationships. Guilt, in other words, can help hold a cooperative species together. It is a kind of social glue.\nViewed in this light, guilt is an opportunity. Work by Tina Malti, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, suggests that guilt may compensate for an emotional deficiency. In a number of studies, Malti and others have shown that guilt and sympathy may represent different pathways to cooperation and sharing Some kids who are low in sympathy may make up for that shortfall by experiencing more guilt, which can rein in their nastier impulses. And vice versa: High sympathy can substitute for low guilt.\nIn a 2014 study, for example, Malti looked at 244 children Using caregiver assessments and the children's self-observations, she rated each child's overall sympathy level and his or her tendency to feel negative emotions after moral transgressions. Then the kids were handed chocolate coins, and given a chance to shared them with an anonymous child. For the low-sympathy kids, how much they shared appeared to turn on how inclined they were to feel guilty. The guilt-prone ones shared more, even though they hadn't magically become more sympathetic to the other child's deprivation\n\" That's good news, \" Malti says. \" We can be prosocial because we caused harm and we feel regret.”\n    21.Researchers think that guilt can be a good thing because it may help____\n    A) foster a child's moral development\n    B) regulate a child's basic emotions\n    C) improve a child’s intellectual ability\n    D) intensity a child's positive feelings\n    22.According to paragraph 2, many people still consider guilt to be____\n    A) inexcusable\n    B) deception\n    C) addictive\n    D) burdensome\n    23. Vaish hold that the rethinking about guilt comes from an awareness that\n    A)emotions air context-independent\n    B)an emotion can play opposing roles\n    C)emotion are socially constructive\n    D) emotional stability can benefit health\n    24. Malti and others have shown that cooperation and sharing ·\n    A. may help correct emotional deficiencies\n    B. can result from either sympathy or guilt\n    C. can bring about emotional satisfaction\n    D. may be the outcome of impulsive aets\n    25.

                    "question": "Forests give us shade, quiet and one of the harder challenges in the fight against climate change. Even as we humans count on forests to soak up a good share of the carbon dioxide we produce, we are threatening their ability to do so.The climate change we are hastening could one day leave us with forests that emit more carbon than they absorb.\nThankfully, there is a way out of this trap . but it involves striking a subtle balance. Helping forests flourish as valuable\"carbon sinks\" long into the future may require reducing their capacity to absorb carbon now, California is leading the way,as it does on so many climate efforts, in figuring out the details.\nThe state's proposed Forest Carbon Plan aims to double efforts to thin out young trees and clear brush in parts of the forest. This temporarily lowers carbon-carrying capacity. But the remaining trees draw a greater share of the available moisture, so they grow and thrive, restoring the forest's capacity to pull carbon from the air. Healthy trees are also better able to fend off insects. The landscape is rendered less easily burnable. Even in the event of a fire, fewer trees are consumed.\nThe need for such planning is increasingly urgent. Already, since 2010,drought and insects have killed over 100million trees in California, most of them in 2016 alone, and wildfires have burned hundreds of thousands of acres.\nCalifornia plans to treat 35,000 acres of forest a year by 2020, and 60,00 by 2030- financed from the proceeds of the state' s emissions- permit auctions, That's only a small share of the total acreage that could benefit, about half a million acres in all, so it will be vital to prioritize areas at greatest risk of fire or drought.\nThe strategy also aims to ensure that carbon in woody material removed from the forests is locked away in the form of solid lumber or burned as biofuel in vehicles that would otherwise run on fossil fuels. New research on transportation biofuels is already under way.\nState governments are well accustomed to managing forests, but traditionally they've focused on wildlife, watersheds and opportunities for recreation. Only recently have they come to see the vital part forests will have to play in storing carbon. Califormia's plan, which is expected to be finalized by the governor next year, should serve as a model.\n    26. By saying \"one of the harder challenges ,\"the author implies that_\n    A. global climate change may get out of control\n    B. people may misunderstand global warming\n    C. extreme weather conditions may arise\n    D. forests may become a potential threat\n    27. To maintain forests as valuable \"carbon sinks,\" we may need to_\n    A. preserve the diversity of species in them\n    B. accelerate the growth of young trees\n    C. strike a balance among different plants\n    D. lower their present carbon- absorbing capacity\n    28.

                    "question": "American farmers have been complaining of labor shortages for several years.The complaints are unlikely to stop without an overhaul of immigration rules for farm works.\nCongress has obstructed efforts to create a more straightforward visa for agricultural workers that would let foreign workers stay longer in the U.S. and change jobs within the industry.If this doesn’t change.American businesses.communities, and consumers will be the losers.\nPerhaps half of U.S. farm laborers are undocumented immigrants. As fewer such workers enter the country, the characteristics of the agricultural workforce are changing. Today's farm laborers, while still predominantly born in Mexico, are more likely to be settled rather than migrating and more likely to be married than single, They're also aging. At the start of this century, about one-third of crop workers were over the age of 35. Now more than half are. And picking crops is hard on older bodies. One oft-debated cure for this labor shortage remains as implausible as it's been all along: Native U.S. workers won't be returning to the farm.\nMechanization is not the answer either—not yet, at least. Production of com,cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat has been largely mechanized, but many high-value, labor-intensive crops, such as strawberries, need labor. Even dairy farms,where robots do a small share of milking, have a long way to go before they ' re automated.\nAs a result, farms have grown increasingly reliant on temporary guest workers using the H-2A visa to fill the gaps in the workforce. Starting around 2012, requests for the visas rose sharply; from 2011 to 2016 the number of visas issued more than doubled.\nThe H-2A visa has no numerical cap, unlike the H-2B visa for nonagricultural work which is limited to 66,000 a year. Even so, employers complain they aren’t given all the workers they need.The process is cumbersome,expensive,and unreliable. One survey found that bureaucratic delays led the average H-2A worker to arrive on the job 22 days late. The shortage is compounded by federal immigration raids, which remove some workers and drive others underground.\nIn a 2012 survey, 71 percent of tree-fruit growers and nearly 80 percent of raisin and berry growers said they were short of labor. Some western growers have responded by moving operations to Mexico. From 1998-2000, 14.5 percent of the fruit Americans consumed was imported. Little more than a decade later, the share of imported fruit had increased to 25.8 percent.\nIn effect, the U.S. can import food or it can import the workers who pick it.\n    31.

They're part of a bunch of celebrities starring in a new video for World Environment Day encouraging you, the consumer, to swap out your single-use plastic staples like straws and cutlery to combat the plastics crisis.\nThe key messages that have been put together for World Environment Day do include a call for governments to enact legislation to curb single-use plastics. But the overarching message is directed at individuals.\nMy concern with leaving it up to the individual, however, is our limited sense of what needs to be achieved. On their own, taking our own bags to the grocery store or quitting plastic straws, for example, will accomplish little and require very little of us. They could even be detrimental, satisfying a need to have \"done our bit\" without ever progressing onto bigger, bolder, more effective actions a kind of \"moral licensing\" that allays our concerns and stops us doing more and asking more of those in charge.\nWhile the conversation around our environment and our responsibility toward it remains centered on shopping bags and straws, we're ignoring the balance of power that implies that as \"consumers\" we must shop sustainably, rather than as\"citizens\" hold our governments and industries to account to push for real systemic change.\nIt's important to acknowledge that the environment isn't everyone's priority - or even most people's. We shouldn't expect it to be. In her latest book, Why Good People Do Bad Environmental Things, Wellesley College professor Elizabeth R. DeSombre argues that the best way to collectively change the behavior of large numbers of people is for the change to be structural.\nThis might mean implementing policy such as a plastic tax that adds a cost to environmentally problematic action,or banning single-use plastics altogether. India has just announced it will \"eliminate all single-use plastic in the country by 2022.\" There are also incentive-based ways of making better environmental choices easier, such as ensuring recycling is at least as easy as trash disposal.\nDeSombre isn't saying people should stop caring about the environment. It's just that individual actions are too slow,she says, for that to be the only, or even primary, approach to changing widespread behavior.\nNone of this is about writing off the individual, It's just about putting things into perspective.

                    "question": "A group of labour MPs, among them Yvette Cooper, are bringing in the new year with a call to institute a UK \"town of culture\" award. The proposal is that it should sit alongside the existing city of culture title, which was held by Hull in 2017 and has been awarded to Coventry for zoz1. Cooper and her colleagues argue that the success of the crown for Hull, where it brought in £220m of investment and an avalanche of arts, out not to be confined to cities. Britain' town, it is true are not prevented from applying, but they generally lack the resources to put together a bit to beat their bigger competitions. A town of culture award could, it is argued, become an annual event, attracting funding and creating jobs.\nSome might see the proposal as a boo by prize for the fact that Britain is no longer be able to apply for the much more prestigious title of European capital of culture, a sough-after award bagged by Glasgow in 1990 and Liverpool in 2008. A cynic might speculate that the UK is on the verge of disappearing into an endless fever of self-celebration in its desperation to reinvent itself for the post-Brexit world: after town of culture, who knows that will follow-village of culture? Suburb of culture? Hamlet of culture?\nIt is also wise to recall that such titles are not a cure-all. A badly run \"year of culture\" washes in and out of a place like the tide, bringing prominence for a spell but leaving no lasting benefits to the community. The really successful holders of such titles are those that do a great deal more than fill hotel bedrooms and bring in high-profile arts events and good press for a year. They transform the aspirations of the people who live there; they nudge the self-image of the city into a bolder and more optimistic light. It is hard to get right, and requires a remarkable degree of vision, as well as cooperation between city authorities, the private sector, community. groups and cultural organisations. But it can be done: Glasgow's year as European capital of culture can certainly be seen as one of complex series of factors that have turned the city into the power of art, music and theatre that it remains today.\nA \"town of culture\" could be not just about the arts but about honouring a town's peculiarities-helping sustain its high street, supporting local facilities and above all celebrating its people and turn it into action.\n    21.Copper and her colleague argue that a \"town of culture\" award would _____.\n    A.consolidate the town city ties in Britain\n    B.promote cooperation among Brains towns\n    C.increase the economic strength of brain s towns\n    D.focus Brain's limited resources on cultural events\n    22.According to paragraph 2, the proposal might be regarded by some as _____.\n    A.a sensible compromise\n    B.a self-deceiving attemp\n    C.an eye-catching bonus\n    D.an inaccessible target\n    23.The author suggests that a title holder is successful only if it _____.\n    A.endeavor to maintain its image\n    B.meets the aspiration of its people\n    C.brings its local arts to prominence\n    D.commits to its long-term growth\n    24.Glasgow is mentioned in Paragraph 3 to present _____.\n    A.a contrasting case\n    B.a supporting example\n    C.a background story\n    D.a related topic\n    25.What is the author 's attitude towards the proposal? _____\n    A.Skeptical\n    B.Objective\n    C.Favorable\n    D.Critical"

                    "question": "Scientific publishing has long been a licence to print money. Scientists need journals in which to publish their research, so they will supply the articles without monetary reward. Other scientists perform the specialised work of peer review also for free, because it is a central element in the acquisition of status and the production of scientific knowledge.\nWith the content of papers secured for free, the publisher needs only find a market for its journal. Until this century, university libraries were not very price sensitive. Scientific publishers routinely report profit margins approaching 40% on their operations, at a time when the rest of the publishing industry is in existential crisis.\nThe Dutch giant Elsevier, which claims to publish 25% of the scientific pepers produced in the world, made profits of more than £900m last year, while UK universities alone spent more than £210m in 2016 to enable researchers to access their own publicly funded research; both figures seem to rise unstoppably despite increasingly desperate efforts to change them.\nThe most drastic, and thoroughly illegal, reaction has been the emergence of Sci-Hub, a kind of global photocopier for scientific papers, set up in 2012, which now claims to offer access to every paywalled article published since 2015. The success of Sci-Hub, which relies on researchers passing on copies they have themselves legally accessed, shows the legal ecosystem has lost legitimacy among is users and must be transformed so that it works for all participants.\nIn Britain the move towars open access publishing has been driven by funding bodies. In some ways it has been very successful. More than half of all British scientific research is now published under open access terms: either freely available from the moment of publication, or paywalled for a year or more so that the publishers can make a profit before being placed on general release.\nYet the new system has not worked out any cheaper for the universities. Publishers have responded to the demand that they make their product free to readers by charging their writers fees to cover the costs of preparingan article. These range from around £500 to $5,000. A report last year pointed out that the costs both of subscriptions and of these “article preparation costs” had been steadily rising at a rate above inflation. In some ways the scientific publishing model resembles the economy of the social internet: labour is provided free in exchange for the hope of status, while huge profits are made by a few big firms who run the market places. In both cases, we need a rebalancing of power.\n    26.Scientific publishing is seen as “a licence to print money” partly because _____.\n    A.its funding has enjoyed a steady increase\n    B.its marketing strategy has been successful\n    C.its payment for peer review is reduced\n    D.its content acquisition costs nothing\n    27. According to Paragraphs 2 and 3, scientific publishers Elsevier have _____.\n    A.thrived mainly on university libraries\n    B.gone through an existential crisis\n    C.revived the publishing industry\n    D.financed researchers generously\n    28. How does the author feel about the success of Sci-Hub? _____\n    A.Relieved\n    B.Puzzled\n    C.Concerned\n    D.Encouraged\n    29. It can be learned from Paragraphs 5 and 6 that open access terms _____.\n    A.allow publishers some room to make money\n    B.render publishing much easier for scientists\n    C.reduce the cost of publication substantially\n    D.free universities from financial burdens\n    30. Which of the following characteristics the scientific publishing mode? _____\n    A.Trial subscription is offered\n    B.Labour triumphs over atstus\n    C.Costs are well controlled\n    D.The few feed on the many"

                    "question": "Progressives often support diversity mandates as a path to equality and a way to level the playing field. But all too often such policies are an insincere form of virtue-signaling that benefits only the most privileged and does little to help average people.\nA pair of bills sponsored by Massachusetts state Senator Jason Lewis and House Speaker Pro Tempore Patricia Haddad, to ensure \"gender parity\" on boards and commissions, provide a case in point.\nHaddad and Lewis are concerned that more than half the state-government boards are less than 40 percent female. In order to ensure that elite women have more such opportunities, they have proposed imposing government quotas. If the bills become law, state boards and commissions will be required to set aside 50 percent of board seats for women by 2022.\nThe bills are similar to a measure recently adopted in California, which last year became the first state to require gender quotas for private companies. In signing the measure, California Governor Jerry Brown admitted that the law, which expressly classifies people on the basis of sex, is probably unconstitutional.\nThe US Supreme Court frowns on sex-based classifications unless they are designed to address an \"important\" policy interest, because the California law applies to all boards, even where there is no history of prior discrimination, courts are likely to rule that the law violates the constitutional guarantee of \"equal protection\".\nBut are such government mandates even necessary? Female participation on corporate boards may not currently mirror the percentage of women in the general population, but so what?\nThe number of women on corporate boards has been steadily increasing without government interference. According to a study by Catalyst, between 2010 and 2015 the share of women on the boards of global corporations increased by 54 percent.\nRequiring companies to make gender the primary qualification for board membership will inevitably lead to less experienced private sector boards. That is exactly what happened when Norway adopted a nationwide corporate gender quota.\nWriting in The New Republic, Alice Lee notes that increasing the number of opportunities for board membership without increasing the pool of qualified women to serve on such boards has led to a \"gold skirt\" phenomenon. Where the same elite women scoop up multiple seats on a variety of boards.\nNext time somebody pushes corporate quotas as a way to promote gender equity, remember that such policies are largely self-serving measures that make their sponsors feel good but do little to help average women.\n    31. The author believes hat the bills sponsored by Lewis and Haddad will _____.\n    A.help little to reduce gender bias.\n    B.pose a threat to the state government.\n    C.raise women's position in politics.\n    D.greatly broaden career options.\n    32. Which of the following is true of the California measure? _____\n    A.It has irritated private business owners.\n    B.It is welcomed by the Supreme Court.\n    C.It may go against the Constitution.\n    D.It will settle the prior controversies.\n    33. The author mentions the study by Catalyst to illustrate _____.\n    A.the harm from arbitrary board decision.\n    B.the importance of constitutional guarantees.\n    C.the pressure on women in global corporations.\n    D.the needlessness of government interventions.\n    34. Norway's adoption of a nationwide corporate gender quota has led to _____.\n    A.the underestimation of elite women's role.\n    B.the objection to female participation on bards.\n    C.the entry of unqualified candidates into the board.\n    D.the growing tension between Labor and management.\n    35. Which of the following can be inferred from the text? _____\n    A.Women's need in employment should be considered.\n    B.Feasibility should be a prime concern in policymaking.\n    C.Everyone should try hard to promote social justice.\n    D.Major social issues should be the focus of legislation."

                    "question": "Last Thursday, the French Senate passed a digital services tax, which would impose an entirely new tax on large multinationals that provide digital services to consumers or users in France. Digital services include everything from providing a platform for selling goods and services online to targeting advertising based on user data. and the tax applies to gross revenue from such services. Many French politicians and media outlets have referred to this as a \"GAFA tax,\" meaning that it is designed to apply primarily to companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon-in other words, multinational tech companies based in the United States.\nThe digital services tax now awaits the signature of President Emmanuel Macron, who has expressed support for the measure, and it could go into effect within the next few weeks. But it has already sparked significant controversy, with the Unite States trade representative opening an investigation into whether the tax discriminates against American companies which in turn could lead to trade sanctions against France.\nThe French tax is not just unilateral move by one country in need of revenue. Instead, the digital services tax is part of a much larger trend, with countries over the past few years proposing or putting in place an alphabet soup of new international tax provisions. These have included Britain's DPT (diverted profits tax).\nAustralia's MAAL (multinational antiavoidance law), and India's SEP(significant economic presence)test, to name but a few. At the same time, the European Union, Spain, Britain and several other countries have all seriously contemplated digital services taxes.\nThese unilateral developments differ in their specifics, but they are all designed to tax multinationals on income and revenue that countries believe they should have a right to tax, even if international tax rules do not grant them that right. In other words, they all share a view that the international tax system has failed to keep up with the current economy.\nIn response to these many unilateral measures, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD)is currently working with 131 countries to reach a consensus by the end of 2020 on an international solution. Both France and the United States are involved in the organization's work, but France's digital services tax and the American response raise questions about what the future holds for the internationa tax system.\nFrance's planned tax is a clear waning: Unless a broad consensus can be reached on reforming the international tax system. other nations are likely to follow suit, and American companies will face a cascade of different taxes from dozens of nations that will prove burdensome and costly.\n    36. The French Senate has passed a bill to _____.\n    A.regulate digital services platforms.\n    B.protect French companies' interests.\n    C.impose a levy on tech multinationals.\n    D. curb the influence of advertising.\n    37. It can be learned from Paragraph 2 that the digital services tax _____.\n    A.may trigger countermeasures against France.\n    B.is apt to arouse criticism at home and abroad.\n    C.aims to ease international trade tensions.\n    D.will prompt the tech giants to quit France.\n    38. The countries adopting the unilateral measures share the opinion that _____.\n    A.redistribution of tech giants' revenue must be ensured.\n    B.the current international tax system needs upgrading\n    C.tech multinationals' monopoly should be prevented.\n    D.all countries ought to enjoy equal taxing rights.\n    39. It can be learned from Paragraph 5that the OECO's current work _____.\n    A.is being resisted by US companies.\n    B.needs to be readjusted immediately.\n    C.is faced with uncertain prospects.\n    D.needs to involve more countries.\n    40. Which of the following might be the best title for this text? _____\n    A.France Is Confronted with Trade Sanctions\n    B.France leads the charge on Digital Tax\n    C.France Says \"No\" to Tech Mutinationals\n    D.France Demands a Role in the Digital Economy"
